I wanted to create an interactive canvas with brushes on P5JS, so I used a YouTube tutorial, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tCvvPDJB274, to learn how to create a paintbrush using ellipses. I wanted to be able to control the colour of the paintbrush, and decided to do this using the sliders I learnt about in Workshop 4, and prompted ChatGPT to help accomplish this. I also wanted to make the brush have a glowing effect, as that is something I had previously done in Workshop 7, and used shadowBlur to achieve that. I used ChatGPT to create deleteButton and saveButton to be able to save the sketch and clear the canvas, I also added boxes to the buttons and the sliders so that the paintbrush wouldn’t touch them, and experimented with the size and placement of these boxes. Originally the ‘Save Drawing’ button saved the sketch to the computer, however I wanted the sketches to turn into a collection of tiles, kind of similar to how My Boyfriend Came Back From the War and Glyphtti both have interactive boxes, so I prompted ChatGPT on how I would be able to turn the sketches into rows of tiles, with the canvas expanding downwards so that it would still be useable. For further development of this sketch I am wanting to add sound effects to the brushstrokes, though so far I haven’t been able to successfully download audio to accomplish this. I also want to make this sketch more collaborative and suitable for multiple users, because what I’ve learned from my contextual research is that collaborativeness is an important part of digital folklore. An example of collaboration that could work in my sketch is multiple people being able to add ‘paintings’ to the collection of tiles, similar to how multiple people can change the pixels in Glyphtti. I am not sure yet how I would accomplish this, but ChatGPT suggested using Firebase Firestore to be able to achieve this.
